Parachute mod for Minecraft 1.6.x (Forge version)
Authored by crackedEgg
The parachute has been redesigned for 1.6.x. It is larger and has it's own textures. You can add
more textures to the jar file following the naming convention of the original textures. You can also,
of course, replace the textures. If you add more just set the texture index in the config file to the
index of your texture.
